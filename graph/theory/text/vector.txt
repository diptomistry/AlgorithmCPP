#2d vector:
vector<vector<int>> matrix:it creates an empty 2D vector where the size of each dimension is not specified.
vector<vector<int>> matrix(n, vector<int>(m));n by m matrix
vector<vector<int>> matrix(n, vector<int>(m, 0)):n rows with m columns and all the elements are initialized with 0
##resize:
1d:
resize( size_type count );

resize( size_type count, const value_type& value );
vector<int> c = {1, 2, 3}; 
c.resize(5);
c.resize(2);
c.resize(6, 4);

The vector holds: 1 2 3
After resize up to 5: 1 2 3 0 0
After resize down to 2: 1 2
After resize up to 6 (initializer = 4): 1 2 4 4 4 4

2d:
//vector<vector<int>> adjList;
adjList.resize(n);After executing this line, adjList will be a vector with n empty vectors
adjList.resize(n, vector<int>(n));After executing this line, adjList will be a vector with n vectors, each initialized to a vector of size n

adjMatrix.resize(n, vector<int>(n, 0));n by n matrix with all the elements 0
