#bfs:explore all the neighbors of the node
#dfs:continue traversing

#topology:https://youtu.be/3tkcfvCNtM8?t=358
#connected:A node and all the nodes reachable from it compose a connected component.
â€¢ A graph is called connected if it has only one connected component.
#Connected: Usually associated with undirected graphs (two way edges): 
There is a path between every two nodes. 
#Strongly connected: Usually associated with directed graphs (one way edges): There is a route between every two nodes (route ~ path in each direction between each pair of vertices).
#biconnected
components:contains no aricular point(is a vertex whose removel will disconnect the graph)
#A maximum set of nodes for which there are
two different paths is called biconnected
components.


#if removing a node increase the number of components ,it will be called a ariculation point
